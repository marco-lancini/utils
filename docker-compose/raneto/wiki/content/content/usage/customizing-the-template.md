/*
Title: Customizing the Template
*/

Templating in Raneto is powered by [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io). All of the template views can
be found in the `themes/default/` folder. Feel free to customize the template as you wish. The template structure
is as follows:

* `layout.html`: The parent template. You'll probably want to customize this first
* `home.html`: The homepage template. Shown if you don't have an [index.md](%base_url%/usage/custom-homepage)
* `page.html`: The template used for single pages
* `search.html`: The template used for search results
* `error.html`: Shown when Raneto encounters an error or can't find a page

Remember you will need to restart the app after changing the template.

## Public Files

All static files in Raneto (images, CSS, Javascript files etc.) are served from the `public` folder. This
is so that no one can access any other files in the install. Only files in the `public` folder are available
to the public.

It's worth noting that when customising Raneto you should always make your own files rather than customising
the existing Raneto files, so that your changes don't get lost when you
[update Raneto](%base_url%/updates/updating-raneto).
