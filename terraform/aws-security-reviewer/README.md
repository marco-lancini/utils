# AWS Security Reviewer

This module automates the setup of roles and users needed to perform a security audit of AWS accounts in an Hub and Spoke model, as described in [Cross Account Auditing in AWS and GCP](https://www.marcolancini.it/2019/blog-cross-account-auditing/).

In short, this module can be used to create:

1. One role (`role_security_audit`) in every AWS account (Hub + all the Spoke ones), with the built-in `SecurityAudit` policy attached to it.
2. One role (`role_security_assume`), in the Hub account, able to assume the `role_security_audit` role on all the Spoke accounts.
3. One IAM user (`user_security_audit`), in the Hub account, able to assume the `role_security_assume` role. Access keys for this user are not managed via this module.

## Usage

From the Hub account:
```terraform
locals {
  account_id  = "AAAAAAAAAAAA"
}

module "security_reviewer" {
  source = "../<path>/security-reviewer"
  providers = {
    aws = aws.ireland
  }

  hub_account_id = local.account_id
  is_hub         = true
}
```

From a Spoke account:
```terraform
locals {
  master_id  = "AAAAAAAAAAAA"
  account_id = "BBBBBBBBBBBB"
}

module "security_reviewer" {
  source = "../<path>/security-reviewer"
  providers = {
    aws = aws.ireland
  }

  hub_account_id = local.master_id
  is_hub         = false
}
```
